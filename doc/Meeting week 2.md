***Week2***

 Important notes:
        
        -In the future we will have to add descriptions to all tasks and have everything in the
         backlog and have everything needing to be done assigned.
        
 
 Backlog: 
 
        - Feautures need to become more descript ( Split the features found in the moscow requirements up more in the backlog)
        - Label all features with must have/should have/could haveon gitlab so its all more logical in the gitlab
         
    
  Features/Technicalities:
  
        - For server component check seperate file in folder.
        - Spring has been seen as the best option.
        - An SQL database being run on perhaps an EWI server should be doable
        - libGDX for the graphics seemed like the best choice for like the board and the likes.
        - A seperate file detailing the collisions and physics can be found

        - menu which can be exited and a new game started
